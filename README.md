# Smart-Garage-Door-using-AWS-and-IoT
Abstract—We are living in a world with smart devices everywhere around us which are impacting our daily life. These technologies sometimes look simpler, but they can make our lives better and more comfortable. In this study, a Smart garage door system that enables the car garage door to be opened and closed remotely through a mobile device and ensures safe parking of vehicles using the external hardware and software development environment via the Arduino platform has been developed. In addition, while the garage door is moving, a light remains open to alert the user along with a smart parking assist that guides the driver to park at safe distance from nearby objects through an ultrasonic sensor, buzzer, and software. This work is designed specifically for the use of Twilio and Google assist to send commands to the cloud server to control and monitor the garage door. We use Arduino, an electronic prototype development platform that offers the possibility to use hardware and software easily, to read the signals from the various sensors, turn on/off motor and light, and run the sensor and buzzer. As the result, we have created a fully functional garage door that can be controlled through a mobile app, providing more control of this mechanical machine, and with the addition of a proximity sensor, we managed to make it even more secure by executing “stop” command when the car is approaching the garage door or wall.
